TODO
===

Introduction
---
I am a **terminal mania**. I prefer terminal to any IDE or visual interfaces When driving my computer. 

I was bothered to using Evernote (on mac) or Zim(Ubuntu) to write a "work list" of what I am going to do in the morning of a day, like:
> [1] OS course work <br/ >
> [2] NIPS paper<br/ >
> [3] Gym!<br/ >
> [4] Give a phone call to my honey<br/ >

And during a whole day's working I will remove or add to the work list. Evernote and Zim both work well, but hardly make me content. So I started to build a new terminal command *todo*, in order to in charge of adding, deleting, showing and clearing the work list.

Installation
---
You will need [boost](http://www.boost.org/) as I use boost APIs to resolve string processing problems.

Makefile is under construction.

Usage
---
Do "todo -h" or "todo --help" in terminal.
